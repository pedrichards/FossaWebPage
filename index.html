    With the female sitting atop a tall tree, male fossas would compete among each other below.
    The mating period typically lasts from several hours to a week because the female sometimes even opts to mate with several suitors. The backwards-pointing shape of the male fossa penis is also another reason why the copulation period lasts long.
    The fossas typically mate on the same tree year after year.

    This is real and we're not making this up. Female fossas temporarily undergo an extremely strange physical change during its adolescence. Scientists call it, "transcient masculinization".
    What this means is that the female fossas begin to develope enlarged, spiky clitoris that looks like a penis. From it, orange substance typically seen in mature males is secreted from its underbelly.
    No one knows why the female fossas undergo such drastic physical change. Some believe it could be a defensive measure to thwart sexual harassment by male fossas.
